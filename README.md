Currently focusing on learning the s&box environment and developing a game in it!  
If you need help with Garry's Mod Lua, especially VGUI, render targets, or stencils you can contact me on discord Cryotheum#4096 or message me on my discord server using the fancy invite button above.

## Wisdom
Includes what some may consider "scripting languages" instead of full-blown programming languages.  
Competency: **Mastered** > **Competent** > **Capable** > **Learning** > **Familiar**
| Language      | Competency | Comments                                                          |

| ARM Assembly  | Familiar   | Rather use C/C++/Rust if I ever need something low-level          |
| C             | Capable    |                                                                   |

| Expression 2  | Mastered   | Programming language written in Garry's Mod Lua                   |
| HLSL          | Learning   |                                                                   |

| SourcePawn    | Capable    | Plugins for SourceMod servers, it's a C++ like scripting language |
| TypeScript    | Competent  | Also know JavaScript, but prefer TypeScript as types are explicit |

Additional "programming languages" that don't deserve an entry in the table above: HTML, Markdown, Sass, SQLite, SurrealDB (learning)

## Things I'm Planning
These plans have no specified timeframe
- Do something with my [github.io](https://github.com/Cryotheus/cryotheus.github.io) (currently [unfinished run-down docs](https://cryotheus.github.io/) for Pyrition and projects other projects)  
	I plan to remake this into something fun with TypeScript, Sass, and GitHub Workflows to automatically document my different projects!
- Learn C++ to competency
- Make my own:
  - Embeddable scripting/language or transpiler
  - Custom IDE
  - Monetized game

## Something missing a license?
Let me know! I will license it under Apache 2.0 or MIT.
