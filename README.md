I do a lot of Lua JIT stuff, most of my projects are incomplete because finishing projects is a sin or something.  
Current project queue:
1. [Pyrition 2](https://github.com/Cryotheus/pyrition_2)
2. [PECan]()
3. Stencil Core 3 (Rewrite of [Stencil Core 2](https://github.com/Cryotheus/e2_stencil_core_2))
4. Game Core 2 (Rewrite of [Game Core](https://github.com/Cryotheus/e2_game_core))

If you need help with GLua, especially vgui, render targets, or stencils you can contact me on discord Cryotheum#4096 or message me on my discord server using the invite above.
